# HinglishEval
Are our Large Language Models good at code-generation when prompted in native languages?

## Prompting in Hinglish
We used GPT-4 to translate prompts in HumanEval to _Hinglish_ and manually verified and fixed these translations. The new dataset, __HinglishEval__ is available as a JSON file (`HinglishEval.json`) in the repository.
